Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Getting an Account

First thing you gotta do is get an account. Go to earthdata.gov and get setup!

## Establishing a Session

You have to be logged in and have a session if you want to do anything, silly! Thankfully there's a function for that.

```
# Fetches a token and saves it to a variable for later use
token <- appeears_start_session(your_username, your_password)

```
